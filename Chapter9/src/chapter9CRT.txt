1.The index number of an element is one less than it's position. For example, the third element of arrayList has index number 2.
2.int[] quantities= new int[20]
3.double[] heights= {1.65, 2.15, 4.95}
4.for (int grades: grades){
system.out.println(grades);
}
5.a.1) create a copy of the first array
2) have the index values that are greater than or equal to the new data be increased by 1
3) copy the new data to the second array
4) copy the second array back in the original array
b.


6.passing a single element: passes by value, you can modify a copy of the element
passing entire array: passes by a reference pointer, you can modify the elements in memory

7.when the first element of the array is never used offsetting an array saves memory

8.for (String name = Elaine : myStrings) 
{System.out.println(Elaine);}}}
