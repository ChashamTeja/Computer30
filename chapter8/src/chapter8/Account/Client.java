Purpose: Create PersonalAcct and BusinessAcct classes that inherit the Account class presented in Chapter 8.
A personal account requires a minimum balance of $100. If the balance falls below this amount, then
$2.00 is charged (withdrawn) to the account. A business account requires a minimum balance of $500,
otherwise the account is charged $10.
