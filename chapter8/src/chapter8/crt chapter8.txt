1.An IS-A relationship is inheritance. The classes which inherit are known as sub classes or child classes. On the other hand, HAS-A relationship is composition.
2.The output will be be both the statements given in base and derived class as the derived class uses "extends" keyword and it can access all properties and methods.
3.An abstract method is a contract which forces its immediate subclass to implement the behaviour of all abstract methods. Where as overriding is optional and is not always a necessity for
 the subclasses. Efficiency of abstract method lies in the fact that they force the immediate subclass to provide implementation.
4.An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override. An interface only allows you to define functionality, not implement it. And 
whereas a class can extend only one abstract class, it can take advantage of multiple interfaces.
6.a.All methods in an interface are public and abstract.
b.wo is an interface .
c.The doThat() method is implemented in Roo because the methods of an interface must be defined in the class that implements the method's interface.
d.The methods available to a Roo object are doThis(), doNow(),and doThat().
e.The doThis() implementation in Roo overrides the doThis() implementation in Bo.
f.The statement super(1) in Roo assigns the value 1 to the variable x from Bo.
g.No, once it is overridden, the compiler no longer recognizes the do(This() method in Bo.
h.Yes, a method in Roo can call the doThis() method in Bo by using the keyword super.
